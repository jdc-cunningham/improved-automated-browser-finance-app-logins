### Status

I have abandoned this effort for now since different sites have problems. Some work, some will throw up a captcha, some will detect the login as a suspicious acitivity and ask you to reset your account... it's not worth it. This was supposed to save me around 10 minutes per iteration but that ten minutes for me is only performed a couple times a month. I've sunk more than 3 days into this project so yeah... it works but needs work.

### Issues

The dom target selector can use work, particularly for balances
