Alright... late start but here we go.

Get my coffee and music going after I write down some plans.

11:46 AM

distracted, alright plan is down, will just start to write code

I still don't have the JSON structure down but I'll get something working

There is the problem of obfuscated selectors too

12:16 PM

I'm feeling it the pump (sufficiently caffinated)

Let's go

12:59 PM

Making progress
I'm going to need to standup the local auth codes db for it to run locally

1:09 PM

I'm feeling dread, so much work to do

Thankfully it's mostly copy-paste stuff I've done in the past

1:28 PM

The hard thing will be making sure all the async stuff run regardless of order while waiting for auth codes

1:36 PM

Taking a quick food break, but a good immediate test would be to have one account accessor working.

Requires:

- working api for auth code look up
  I can manually fill the value in for SMS
- puppeteer works all the way through

Then I'll transition to DB look up of the JSON

Write to spreadsheet

Work on the CE to add more stuff

Make it live

1:45 PM back from food break 

I just had an idea, I don't need to use Twilio

I'll just use a web interface, it does suck but regardless my current approach requires human intervention

This will make development easier since I don't have to put this code on a remote server/deal with Twilio

At the end of the day I just need this thing to exist so I don't have to manually grab my 17 accounts

1:53 PM

Alright focus, got my focus playlist going (Trivium In Waves current)

Put timestamp on completion

- [x] front end that can insert/update auth codes
- [x] API that can get auth code by GET query parameter
- [ ] run through one auth run
- [ ] insert into spreadsheet
- [ ] check multiple works
- [ ] chrome extension to manually grab and store process
- [ ] run all and record for medium post

I want to get this done today

2:07 PM

# I'M JUST WEATHERING A ROUGH PATCH

lmao, Slipknot

2:17 PM

Ahh man Korn good shit

2:50 PM

weird bug `page.$eval` is stuck, not advancing, taking a screenshot I see the page is loaded, waited for element
but not able to interact with it based on the query selector I'm using hmm

3:08 PM

have transitioned to slav king

issue above was variables not getting passed into page.eval context

still stuck though, hard to do something headless when interacting with a dom

3:31 PM

oooohhhh there's a recaptcha popping up damn

set headless mode to false and saw it

Okay... so a simple solution for now is if there is a captcha, run it non-headless

Since I'm going to hit go and watch it run, also enter 2FA that comes up
