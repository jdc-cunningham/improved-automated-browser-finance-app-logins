Alright... late start but here we go.

Get my coffee and music going after I write down some plans.

11:46 AM

distracted, alright plan is down, will just start to write code

I still don't have the JSON structure down but I'll get something working

There is the problem of obfuscated selectors too

12:16 PM

I'm feeling it the pump (sufficiently caffinated)

Let's go

12:59 PM

Making progress
I'm going to need to standup the local auth codes db for it to run locally

1:09 PM

I'm feeling dread, so much work to do

Thankfully it's mostly copy-paste stuff I've done in the past

1:28 PM

The hard thing will be making sure all the async stuff run regardless of order while waiting for auth codes
