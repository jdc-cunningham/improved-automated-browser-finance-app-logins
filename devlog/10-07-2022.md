I'm finally getting sick of playing video games and watching TV.

I've been down since 23 days ago... something hit me. I have not been able to work on anything.

I think I'm past it. This project is a blocker for me. I need to finish this/have it working to move on with the rest of my life.

I have many accounts that I keep having to log into... it takes me about ten minutes to login to all of them even with time-reducing features like biometric login.

This is mostly a base for sanity for me. I know what my burn rate is, how f'd I am debt wise.
