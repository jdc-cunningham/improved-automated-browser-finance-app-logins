9:53 AM day off

I did have a thought, the balance getter part of this thing is not able to get multiple values right now, need to support that.

I keep having problems with accounts not liking automated logins

Yeah one particular account is asking me to change my password... must be a no-useragent deal

Even running headless though it has the same issue.

Well... this is disappointing... the process is there but it depends if the site allows it or not, some do

You can get around it, add headers, investigate, but I keep sinking time into this thing and it's already a partial failure

Ahh... well yeah I'm going to move on
