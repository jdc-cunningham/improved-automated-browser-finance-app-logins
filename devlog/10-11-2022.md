This app still has jank, the chrome extension in particular sometimes doesn't save right/need to refresh

Thankfully no data loss, the UI just screws up

I have to add the rest of my accounts, so as I do that I'll do any code updates I need to

Still have not added more, kinda feel dread but I will finish adding more accounts, have a day off coming up
