alright... let's go

Feeling slow... stagnant, gotta get the pump going

10:54 AM

making progress still feel this dread of how much work I gotta do

11:27 AM

The interactive dom selector is interesting

I'll need to autopopulate selectors based on what's there

11:42 AM

Need to start making tangible progress

Gotta deal with this pick element thing

1:15 PM

having problems with some things not saving

things not deleting from localStore ugh

1:33 PM

feeding type (pig squeal sound)

1:47 PM

man I'm feeling spent, still working on the CE

have not done the DB/spreadsheet write, multi-run integration

oof...

I will focus on getting the CE done, to generate that JSON, then write it into a DB so it can get pulled into the multi-task runner.

still have to write into spreadsheet but I've done that before

2:12 PM

losing focus

3:27 PM

I have db saving now, gotta recollect my thoughts, really losing drive

4:08 PM

losing track of what I'm doing

I think I can do an easy "done when" with two automated runs.

That proves it can do multiple and they're added by CE

So I gotta figure out how the run sync process works

5:29 PM

Got the multi-processing thing written but not tested yet, still ironing out another account

5:38 PM

There's a step that's not working and it's hard to debug since if I use non-headless it has a user state/doesn't use 2FA

Tried incognito still doesn't ask for 2FA

Problem is I don't have it detecting if 2FA is skipped

6:08 PM

Ugh... BOFA is flaky for automated login

not a good idea to dev against prod I get that

will do insert to spreadsheet now so I have one successful run

6:29 PM

Well I'm not going to be able to finish this today.

Most of the functionality is done but there's still more tweaks, actual multi-account which I have to go through and add the rest
